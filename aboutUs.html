<h1>Donovan, Owner of  Island Quizine</h1>

<p>Donovan Murphy’s standout career in the restaurant industry  includes his being the owner and CEO of Nigel Buckley, LLC, which is an enterprise that consists of two Island Quizine restaurants in Windsor Mill and Pikesville, Md.  Donovan is an integral part of what makes Island Quizine restaurants work.  He represents the union of customer service, attention to detail, congenial professionalism and passionate knowledge that helps unite a kitchen and its clients for an all-around incredible dining experience.</p>

<p>Donovan grew up in St. Catherine, Jamaica where as a young adult, he worked as a project manager for a non-profit organization that ensured that highly impoverished children and families received basic necessities. He later moved to the U.S. where he pursued a Bachelor of Science degree in Environmental Sciences and a Masters degree in Criminal Justice and Criminology.  Donovan continues to work on planting roots in the community with his involvement in chairing the membership board of the Liberty Road Business Association. In addition, he is involved in a number of charities to include projects to assist in alleviating homelessness in Baltimore where he resides.  In addition, he has donated a computer lab that shows a clear commitment to upgrade the standard of his alma mater in Jamaica.</p>

<p>For Donovan, it’s not only just to serve the guests, but it’s the relationship that is created with the guests and the importance of that. Donovan does it all: When he is not fulfilling his obligation as a fiber optic engineer with Comcast, he is meeting with prospective clients for upcoming catering assignments or shopping with his executive chef for the best products for the restaurants. You can  catch a glimpse of Donovan as he runs in and out of  the kitchens at Island Quizine or interacting with customers who come in for take-out or dine-in. Donovan believes that it is about cultivating a clientele that recognizes that from the moment they walk in to when they’re home thinking about it, it’s a genuine experience.</p>

<p>Donovan enjoys watching the Investigative Discovery (ID) channel, traveling, and sleeping, what little he gets of it, as well as spending time with his family.</p>

<p>Interestingly, despite Donovan’s educational background, he has come to the realization that the restaurant industry is his passion.  Donovan is simply about food and services. “It doesn’t get better than this.”</p>
